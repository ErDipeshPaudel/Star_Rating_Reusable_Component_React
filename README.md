This Star Rating Component is completely reusable in any project!
There is option to change the fontSize, number of stars and other numbers of customization rating like passing the list of texts like 'ok' 'bad' 'amazing' and use it as rating.


While using this component if you dont pass the arguments i mentioned there it is also ok, because there i have set some default value using destructuring!
